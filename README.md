# PurplebricksTestTask

This is a test task by Levon Barsegjan.

## Setup

1. To set up dependencies, run `npm install`
2. To build the project, run `npm run build`
3. The page is under /PurplebricksTestTask/public/index.html

## Things I wanted to include but didn't manage to

1. Animations for collapsible boxes (would have used [react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion))
2. Unit tests for the two stateful components (Response and CollapsibleContainer)
3. A font that is closer to the original design
